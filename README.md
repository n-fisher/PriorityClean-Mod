## Known Incompatibilities
- If used with Hatti's CleaningArea mod, pawns can get stuck in place if there is filth to PriorityClean in zones they are not allowed to enter. You'll need to manually disable a pawn's Clean+ work assignment or expand the CleaningArea zone to match your preferences in PriorityClean's ModSettings.
